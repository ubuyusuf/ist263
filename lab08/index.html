        <h1>Ubah Yusuf's Biography</h1>
        <p class=" Burble">I am a junior and currently majoring in History and Information Technology Management.
        I've always wanted to be a history teacher, but that changed last semester when my phone was tapped,
        <strong>Which motivated my interest in IT, specifically cybersecurity</strong>
    
        </p>
        <p class="dut">It is crucial for someone pursuing cybersecurity to understand how a website is built and how it works, 
            because web developers may write error code, causing the website to be insecure. </p>
