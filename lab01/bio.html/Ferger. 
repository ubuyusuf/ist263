    My name is Ubah Yusuf.
I am a junior majoring in History and minoring in Information Technology Management.
I've always wanted to be a history teacher, but that changed last semester when my phone was tapped, which motivated my interest in IT, specifically cybersecurity.
I'm working on getting my network+ and Linux certifications by the end of the year.
My hobbies include reading, cooking, and occasionally assisting my siblings with their homework as well as my mother with paperwork and translating.
