   <h1>Sociology of African American Experience</h1>
   <p>My project goes deep into the historical and contemporary status of various factors and how those factors affect performance in Nottingham High school. However, to provide an overview, the performance in schools between black and white students has historically been significantly different. In many cases, Black Americans always had it worse. They faced challenges getting access to school, challenges with their education that led to dropping out, and faced more disciplinary actions such as expulsion and suspension. It is not that Black American children were bad or less capable. The difficulties in their lives often came as a result of hardships that came with the time period. The situation in the United States at the moment was significantly unbalanced, with whites controlling much of the economic, and social benefits. For African Americans, it was always a struggle for survival and recognition. These struggles that blacks faced have improved over the past decades. However, the revival of policies that try to disregard the black oppression across history is a way of giving whites the upper hand in an already unbalanced America, and this is exactly why we are seeing unbalance in educating every child in this nation. In addition, while the disparities have reduced, they are not yet over, therefore, black Americans still face the racial, social, and economic disadvantages that keep white students much ahead in education.

   <p>The purpose of this project paper is to discuss a sociological context of how financial, racial, environmental, and social disparities across races, that is, between white and black Americans, affect performance in education and make a school with majority students as white perform better than another with majority students as African Americans. This goal is achieved by analyzing and comparing performance differences between Nottingham High School, with 78.8% minority enrollment, and Liverpool High school, with 75.8% white enrollment, both in Onondaga County, New York (Nottingham High School, n.d.; Liverpool High School, n.d.). This analysis and comparison are necessary and significant in this project because the two schools are racially segregated, and despite being located in the same geographical area, the performance between the two schools differs significantly such that Liverpool High School performs way better than Nottingham High School.

   <h2>Finances and Black Education</h2>
   <p>Financial differences between black and whites is always a reason why whites get to achieve more in life. In history, this is represented in the article by Stamps and Stamps (2008) when they state how black Americans had few opportunities to obtain employment in the 1980s. They explain that most black Americans only obtained jobs as laborers in industries. In addition, many black American students had to drop out of school to work so they could help their families survive. Today, the situation among black Americans and other racial minorities is not different. In the statistics on Nottingham High School, the writer states that 78% of the students are economically disadvantaged, and 77% depend on the free lunch program for meals. On the other hand, only 36% of students in Liverpool High school are economically challenged, and 32% depending on the free lunch program. The effect of this is often seen when more black students drop out of school or take longer than 4 years to complete high school education (Elementary & High School Education, n.d.)..
      It is not just statistics and historical analysis that show financial problems as a significant reason for black education. In research, Addo et al. (2016) state that many black parents cannot afford education for their children. Therefore, students who want to seek higher education resolve to take student loans. However, these loans develop to become a significant challenge and a contributor to financial differences between races because many black graduates are still struggling to pay for their heavy loans.
