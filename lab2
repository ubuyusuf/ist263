            <h1>Ubah Yusuf's Biography</h1>
    
    
            <p>I am a junior and currently majoring in History and minoring in Information Technology Management.
            I've always wanted to be a history teacher, but that changed last semester when my phone was tapped,
            <strong>Which motivated my interest in IT, specifically cybersecurity</strong>
                
            </p>
        
            <p>It is crucial for someone pursuing cybersecurity to understand how a website is built and how it works, 
                because web developers may write error code, causing the website to be insecure. </p>
            
            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>My hobbies include reading, cooking, and occasionally assisting my siblings with their homework as well as my mother with paperwork and translating</p>
