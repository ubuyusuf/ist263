      <p>The purpose of this projectis to discuss a sociological context of how financial, racial, environmental, and social disparities across races, that is, between white and black Americans, affect performance in education and make a school with majority students as white perform better than another with majority students as African Americans. This goal is achieved by analyzing and comparing performance differences between Nottingham High School, with 78.8% minority enrollment, and Liverpool High school, with 75.8% white enrollment, both in Onondaga County, New York (Nottingham High School, n.d.; Liverpool High School, n.d.). This analysis and comparison are necessary and significant in this project because the two schools are racially segregated, and despite being located in the same geographical area, the performance between the two schools differs significantly such that Liverpool High School performs way better than Nottingham High School.

      <p class="secondtexthomepage">Financial differences between black and whites is always a reason why whites get to achieve more in life. In history, this is represented in the article by Stamps and Stamps (2008) when they state how black Americans had few opportunities to obtain employment in the 1980s. They explain that most black Americans only obtained jobs as laborers in industries. In addition, many black American students had to drop out of school to work so they could help their families survive. Today, the situation among black Americans and other racial minorities is not different. In the statistics on Nottingham High School, the writer states that 78% of the students are economically disadvantaged, and 77% depend on the free lunch program for meals. On the other hand, only 36% of students in Liverpool High school are economically challenged, and 32% depending on the free lunch program. The effect of this is often seen when more black students drop out of school or take longer than 4 years to complete high school education (Elementary & High School Education, n.d.)..
         It is not just statistics and historical analysis that show financial problems as a significant reason for black education. In research, Addo et al. (2016) state that many black parents cannot afford education for their children. Therefore, students who want to seek higher education resolve to take student loans. However, these loans develop to become a significant challenge and a contributor to financial differences between races because many black graduates are still struggling to pay for their heavy loans.
