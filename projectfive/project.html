            <p>The purpose of this projectis to discuss a sociological context of how financial, racial, environmental, and social disparities across races, that is, between white and black Americans, affect performance in education and make a school with majority students as white perform better than another with majority students as African Americans. This goal is achieved by analyzing and comparing performance differences between Nottingham High School, with 78.8% minority enrollment, and Liverpool High school, with 75.8% white enrollment, both in Onondaga County, New York (Nottingham High School, n.d.; Liverpool High School, n.d.). This analysis and comparison are necessary and significant in this project because the two schools are racially segregated, and despite being located in the same geographical area, the performance between the two schools differs significantly such that Liverpool High School performs way better than Nottingham High School.
